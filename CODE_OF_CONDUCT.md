# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

Severus is built by developers, for developers. We aim to create a welcoming environment focused on solving real problems.

### Encouraged Behavior

- **Be direct and honest**: Technical feedback should be clear and constructive
- **Focus on the problem**: Discuss code, features, and solutions rather than personalities
- **Share knowledge**: Help others understand security concepts and best practices
- **Respect different workflows**: Not everyone manages secrets the same way
- **Test your suggestions**: If proposing changes, try them out first

### Unacceptable Behavior

- **Security shaming**: Don't mock people for past security mistakes - we've all been there
- **Gatekeeping**: Don't dismiss contributors based on experience level
- **Harassment**: Personal attacks, discriminatory language, or unwelcome advances
- **Malicious code**: Don't submit code intended to compromise security
- **Spam or trolling**: Stay focused on improving the project

## Scope

This applies to:

- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Code comments and documentation
- Any communication in Severus project spaces

## Enforcement

Project maintainers will address violations by:

1. Warning the person privately
2. Temporary restriction from project participation
3. Permanent ban for serious or repeated violations

We're more interested in maintaining a productive environment than punitive measures.

## Contact

Report issues to the project maintainer via GitHub issues or email: ekomobongarchibong24@gmail.com

_Remember: We're all just trying to stop developers from putting API keys in sticky notes._
